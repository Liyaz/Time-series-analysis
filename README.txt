Time Series Data Analysis is a way of studying the characteristics of the response variable with respect to time as the independent variable. To estimate the target variable in the name of predicting or forecasting, use the time variable as the point of reference. A Time-Series represents a series of time-based orders ¹.

Time series analysis is part of predictive analysis, gathering data over consistent intervals of time (a.k.a. collecting time series data). It’s an effective tool that allows us to quantify the impact of management decisions on future outcomes ².
